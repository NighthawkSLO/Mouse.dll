Mouse.dll
===

Mouse.dll is a plugin for [Rainmeter](http://www.rainmeter.net) that will run an Action when interacting with the mouse.

The actions are independent from the update cycle, removing the need for a fast update value for accurate values.

The documentation and example skin are available in the [wiki](https://github.com/NighthawkSLO/Mouse.dll/wiki/Documentation)
